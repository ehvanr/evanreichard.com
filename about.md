# About

My name is Evan Reichard. I currently work full time for Verizon in Security and reside in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Prior to Verizon I attended Rochester Institute of Technology and received a B.S. in Information Technology. I also have an A.A.S. in Cyber Security from my Community College, SUNY Rockland. 

My technical interests vary widely. I've recently been dabbling in Android Security (and security in general), but I'm also interested in Linux Administration, Clustering, HA and Elastic Scaling, Programming, Windows Administration, Network Administration, and Computer Engineering. You'll probably see posts related to everything listed here :smile:

I'm comfortable with Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, Python, SQL, PowerShell, and Bash. Recently I've been teaching myself Go.
