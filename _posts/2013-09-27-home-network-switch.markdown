About a year ago we had the ceiling of the basement all open for radiant floor installation – I decided to wire every room in the house (Why not? Everything was open) Yeah it’s not a rack, but I didn’t feel it was necessary to purchase one for a household installation.  Anyway, here’s what it looks like – not too shabby if I say so myself. (I did separate the power cord from the Cat-5e cable.)
