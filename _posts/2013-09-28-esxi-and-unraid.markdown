Back in 2011 I decided to go ahead and build my first computer.  My first computer that I built was not a desktop, but a server that would run ESXi.  I had planned to run unRAID, a non-standard software RAID solution as one of the VM’s with a SAS RAID Controller in I/O Passthrough.  As well as a few other VM’s as a test lab to learn :smile:

These are the full specs:

- Intel Xeon E3-1230 3.2GHz Quad-Core Processor
- SUPERMICRO MBD-X9SCM-F-O LGA1155 Motherboard
- 2 x Kingston 8GB (2 x 4GB) ECC Unbuffered DDR3 1333 (16GB Total)
- SUPERMICRO AOC-SASLP-MV8 PCIe x 4 SAS RAID Controller
- NORCO RPC-4220
- SeaSonic X Series X-850 850W EPS12V

It was a pretty easy install with no problems to be honest.  [Here][1] are a few pictures.
